# CHESS_GAME
The project ‘DESIGNING OF CHESS GAME USING SFML COMPUTER GRAPHICS’ implements a classic version of Chess with a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. Our implementation of Chess is for two players. It is played on an 8x8 checked board, with a square in each player's lowerleft corner. We successfully created a GUI based version, inheritance and templates, as specified. Despite several unusual bugs in the GUI, our chess program is a great, user-friendly game for a player vs computer.
